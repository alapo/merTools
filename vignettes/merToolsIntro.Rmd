## Introduction

Working with generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and linear mixed models (LMM) 
has become increasingly easy with the advances in the `lme4` package recently. 
As we have found ourselves using these models more and more within our work, we, 
the authors, have developed a set of tools for simplifying and speeding up common 
tasks for interacting with `merMod` objects from `lme4`. This package provides 
those tools. 

## Illustrating Model Effects

As the complexity of the model fit grows, it becomes harder and harder to 
interpret the substantive effect of parameters in the model.
